# Computer Network Notes

## 1) Introduction to Computer Networks
- **Internet**: A global network connecting millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks.
- **Intranet**: A private network accessible only to an organizationâ€™s members, employees, or others with authorization.
- **Extranet**: A controlled private network that allows access to partners, vendors, and suppliers while restricting access to outsiders.
- **Internet**: Facilitates global communication and resource sharing.

---

## 2) Computer Network
- **Definition**: A system of interconnected computers or nodes to share resources and communicate.
- **Nodes**: Devices or data points in a network (e.g., computers, printers).
- **Hops**: The steps or intermediate devices data passes through to reach its destination.

---

## 3) Data Communication (DC)
- **Definition**: Exchange of data between two devices using a transmission medium.
  
**Components of DC**:
- **Sender**: The device sending data.
- **Receiver**: The device receiving data.
- **Data**: Information to be communicated.
- **Transmission Medium**: The physical path for data transfer (e.g., cables, wireless).
- **Protocol**: A set of rules for data transmission.

---

## 4) Network Models
- **Client-Server**: A centralized model where clients request resources from a server.
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**: A decentralized model where devices (peers) communicate directly.

## 5) Network Applications
- **Examples**: 
  - Email
  - Web browsing
  - Video conferencing
  - File sharing
  - Online gaming
  - Remote access

## 6) Network Criteria

### Performance
- **Transmit Time**: Time taken to transfer data.
- **Response Time**: Time taken to respond to a request.
- **Bandwidth**: Maximum data transfer rate.
- **Throughput**: Actual rate of successful data transfer.
- **Delay**: Time taken for data to travel from source to destination.

### Reliability
- **Availability**, **Error Rate**, and **Recovery mechanisms**.

### Security
- **CIA Triad**:
  - **Confidentiality**: Ensures data is accessible only to authorized users.
  - **Integrity**: Ensures data accuracy and consistency.
  - **Availability**: Ensures data and resources are accessible when needed.
- **Authentication**: Verifying identity.
- **Authorization**: Granting access permissions.
- **Access Control**: Restricting unauthorized access.

---

## 7) Protocol
- A set of rules defining data exchange in a network (e.g., HTTP, FTP, TCP/IP).

---

## 8) Standards
- Guidelines or specifications ensuring compatibility and interoperability in networks (e.g., IEEE, ISO).

---

## 9) Transmission Modes/Data Flow
- **Simplex**: Data flows in one direction only.
- **Half-Duplex**: Data flows in both directions but one direction at a time.
- **Full-Duplex**: Data flows in both directions simultaneously.

---

## 10) Line Configuration (Types of Connection)
- **Point-to-Point**: Direct link between two devices.
- **Multipoint**: Shared link among multiple devices.

---

## 11) Physical Topology
### Types:
- **Bus**: Single backbone cable connects all devices.
- **Star**: Devices connected to a central hub.
- **Ring**: Devices connected in a circular format.
- **Mesh**: Every device connected to every other device.
- **Hybrid**: Combination of two or more topologies.

---

## 12) Types of Networks
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Covers a small geographical area (e.g., office, home).
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Covers a city or a large campus.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Covers large geographical areas, connecting multiple LANs.
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: Small network for personal devices.
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: Secure connection over the internet.

---

## 13) Types of Servers
- **Web Server**: Hosts websites.
- **File Server**: Stores and manages files.
- **Mail Server**: Manages email communication.
- **Database Server**: Provides database services.
- **Application Server**: Hosts and runs applications.
- **Proxy Server**: Acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources.
